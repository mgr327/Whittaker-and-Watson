\index{Gamma-function}

Historically, the Gamma-functioni$^*$\footnote{The notation
  $\Gamma(z)$ was introduced by Legendre in
  1814.} % TODO symbol footnote
$\Gamma(z)$ was first defined by Euler as the limit of a product
(\hardsubsectionref{12}{1}{1}) from which can be derived the infinite
integral $\int_0^\infty t^{z - 1} e^{-t} \dmeasure t$; but in
developing the theory of the function, it is more convenient to define
it by means of an infinite product of Weierstrass' canonical form.

Consider the product \index{Weierstrassian product}\index{product for
  the Gamma-function}
$ze^{\gamma z} \prod_{n=1}^\infty \thebrace{\theparen{1 + \frac{z}{n}}
  e^{-\frac{z}{n}}}$ , where
$\gamma = \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \thebrace{ \frac{1}{1} + \half +
  \ldots + \frac{1}{m} - \log m} = 0 \cdot 5772157 \ldots$ .

%\begin{smalltext} % TODO 
[The constant $\gamma$ is known as Euler's or Mascheroni's constant
\index{Constant, Euler's or Mascheroni's}\index{Euler's constant}\index{Mascheroni's constant}; to
prove that it exists we observe that, if
\begin{displaymath}
u_n = \int_0^1 \frac{t}{n (n + t)} \dmeasure t = \frac{1}{n} -
\log\frac{n+1}{n} ,
\end{displaymath}
$u_n$ Is positive and less than $\int_0^1 \frac{\dmeasure t}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^2}$;
therefore $\sum_{n=1}^\infty u_n$ converges, and 
\begin{displaymath}
  \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \thebrace{ \frac{1}{1} + \half 
      + \ldots + \frac{1}{m} - \log m} =
  \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \thebrace{\sum_{n=1}^mx u_n  - 
      \log \frac{m+1}{m}} =
  \sum_{n=1}^\infty u_n .
\end{displaymath}

The value of $\gamma$ has been calculated by J.~C.~Adams to 260 places of
decimals.]
%\end{smalltext}

The product under consideration represents an analytic function of $z$,
for all values of $z$; for, if $N$ be an integer such that $\absval{z} \le
\half  N$, we have$^\dagger$\footnote{Taking the principal value
  of $\log(1 + z/n)$.},% TODO symbol footnote
if n > N,
\begin{align*}
\absval{\log \theparen{1 + \frac{z}{n}} - \frac{z}{n}} 
& =   \absval{ -\half  \frac{z^2}{n^2} + \frac{1}{3} \frac{z^3}{n^3} -
  \ldots} \\
& \le \frac{|z|^2}{n^2} \thebrace{ 1 + \absval{\frac{z}{n}} +
      \absval{\frac{z^2}{n^2}} + \ldots} \\
& \le \frac{1}{4} \frac{N^2}{n^2} \thebrace{ 1 + \half +
      \frac{1}{2^2} + \ldots} \le \half  \frac{N^2}{n^2} .
\end{align*}

Since the series $\sum_{n = N+1}^\infty
\thebrace{\frac{N^2}{2n^2}}$ converges, it follows that,  when
$|z| \le \half N$,

%
% 236
%

$\sum_{n = N+1}^\infty \absval{\log \theparen{1 + \frac{z}{n}} -
  \frac{z}{n}}$ is an absolutely and uniformly convergent series of
analytic functions, and so it is an analytic function
\hardsectionref{5}{3}); consequently its exponential
$\prod_{n=N+1}^\infty \thebrace{\theparen{1 + \frac{z}{n}}
  e^{-\frac{z}{n}}}$ is an analytic function, and so
$ze^{\gamma z} \prod_{n=1}^\infty \thebrace{\theparen{1 +
    \frac{z}{n}}  e^{-\frac{z}{n}}}$ is an analytic function when
$|z| \le \half N$, where $N$ is any integer; that is to say, the
product is analytic for all finite values of $z$.

The Gamma-function was defined by
Weierstrass$^*$\footnote{\emph{Journal f\"ur Math.}
  \textsc{LI}. (1856). This formula for $\Gamma(z)$ had been obtained
  from Euler's formula \hardsubsectionref{12}{1}{1}) in 1848 by
  F. W. Newman, \emph{Cambridge and Dublin Math. Journal},
  \textsc{III}.  (1848), p. 60.} % TODO footnote/reference
by the equation
\begin{displaymath}
  \frac{1}{\Gamma(z)} = ze^{\gamma z} \prod_{n=1}^\infty
  \thebrace{\theparen{1 + \frac{z}{n}}  e^{-\frac{z}{n}}} ;
\end{displaymath}
\index{Weierstrassian product} from this equation \emph{it is apparent that
$\Gamma(z)$ is analytic except at the points

\Subsection{12}{1}{2}{The difference equation satisfied by the
  Gamma-function.} 

\index{Difference equation satisfied by the Gamma-function} We shall
now shew that the function $\Gamma(z)$ satisfies the difference
equation
\begin{displaymath}
  \Gamma(z + 1) = z \Gamma(z) .
\end{displaymath}
For, by Euler's formula, if $z$ is not a negative integer,
\begin{align*}
\Gamma(z + 1)/\Gamma(z) 
  &= 
    \frac{1}{z+1} \thebracket{\lim_{m \rightarrow \infty}
    \prod_{n=1}^{m} \frac{\theparen{1 + \frac{1}{n}}^{z+1}}{
    1 + \frac{z+1}{n}} }

    \thebracket{ \frac{1}{z} \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty}

  &= 
    \frac{z}{z+1} \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{n=1}^{m} 
    \thebrace{\frac{\theparen{1 + \frac{1}{n}}(z+n)}{z + n + 1}} \\
  &= 
    z \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \frac{m+1}{z + m + 1} = z .
\end{align*}
This is one of the most important properties of the Gamma-function.
Since $\Gamma(1) = 1$, it follows that, if $z$ is a positive integer, 
$\Gamma(z) = (z - 1)!$.

  $m \rightarrow \infty$ when $z$ is not a negative integer.]
\end{wandwexample*}

\Subsection{12}{1}{3}{The evaluation of a general class of infinite products.}

By means of the Gamma-function, it is possible to evaluate the general
class of infinite products of the form
\begin{displaymath}
  \prod_{n=1}^\infty u_n ,
\end{displaymath}
where $u_n$ is any rational function of the index $n$.

For, resolving $n$ into its factors, we can write the product in the
form
\begin{displaymath}
  \prod_{n=1}^\infty 
  \thebrace{\frac{A (n - a_1)(n - a_2) \ldots (n - a_k)}{(n-b_1) \ldots (n-b_l)}};
\end{displaymath}
and it is supposed that no factor in the denominator vanishes.

In order that this product may converge, the number of factors in the
numerator must clearly be the same as the number of factors in the
denominator, and also $A=1$; for, otherwise, the general factor of the
product would not tend to the value unity as $n$ tends to infinity.

We have therefore $k = l$, and, denoting the product by $P$, we may write
\begin{displaymath}
  P = \prod_{n=1}^\infty 
  \thebrace{\frac{(n - a_1) \ldots (n - a_k)}{(n-b_1) \ldots (n-b_k)}} .
\end{displaymath}

The general term in this product can be written
\begin{multline*}
  \theparen{1 - \frac{a_1}{n}} \ldots \theparen{1 - \frac{a_k}{n}} 
  \theparen{1 - \frac{b_1}{n}}^{-1} \ldots \theparen{1 - \frac{b_k}{n}}^{-1} \\
  = 1 - \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_k - b_1 - \ldots - b_k}{n} + A_n
\end{multline*}
where $A_n$ is $\bigo(n^{-2})$ when $n$ is large.

In order that the infinite product may be absolutely convergent, it is
therefore necessary further (\hardsectionref{2}{7}) that
\begin{displaymath}
  a_1 + \ldots + a_k - b_1 - \ldots - b_k = 0.
\end{displaymath}
%
% 239
%
We can therefore introduce the factor
\begin{displaymath}
  \exp \thebrace{ n^{-1} \theparen{a_1 + \ldots + a_k - b_1 - \ldots - b_k}}
\end{displaymath}
into the general factor of the product, without altering its value;
and thus we have
\begin{displaymath}
  P = \prod_{n=1}^\infty 
  % use \vphantom to have parenthesis of the same size in the
  % numerator and the denominator
  \thebrace{
    \frac{
      \theparen{1 - \displaystyle \frac{a_1\vphantom{b_1}}{n}}e^{\frac{a_1}{n}}
      \theparen{1 - \displaystyle \frac{a_2\vphantom{b_1}}{n}}e^{\frac{a_2}{n}}  \ldots
      \theparen{1 - \displaystyle \frac{a_k\vphantom{b_1}}{n}}e^{\frac{a_k}{n}}
    }{
      \theparen{1 - \displaystyle \frac{b_1}{n}}e^{\frac{b_1}{n}} \ldots 
      \theparen{1 - \displaystyle \frac{b_k}{n}}e^{\frac{b_k}{n}}}
  } .
\end{displaymath}

But it is obvious from the Weierstrassian definition of the Gamma-
function that
\begin{displaymath}
  \prod_{n=1}^\infty \thebrace{\theparen{1 -
        \frac{z}{n}}e^{\frac{z}{n}} } = 
    \frac{1}{-z \Gamma(-z) e^{-\gamma z}} ,
\end{displaymath}
and so $\displaystyle P = \frac{\displaystyle b_1 \Gamma(-b_1) b_2
  \Gamma(-b_2) \ldots b_k \Gamma(-b_k)}{
  \displaystyle a_1 \Gamma(-a_1) \ldots a_k \Gamma(-a_k)} =
\prod_{m=1}^k \frac{\displaystyle \Gamma(1-b_m)}{\displaystyle \Gamma(1-a_m)}$;
a formula which expresses the general infinite product $P$ in terms of
the Gamma-function.
\begin{wandwexample}
  % Example 1.

  \begin{displaymath}
    " (a-i-6 + ) \ r(a + l)r (6-1-1) s=i (a+ ) (6-l-s) T a + b + ) '

r, z)=j\'- (e-'-\ + t-, + ... + -)>'- dt,

where k is the integer so chosen that -k>x>-k-l, x being the real part
of z. By partial integration we have, when s < - 1,

r,(.)=[f(.-.-n.<-il + ...+(-r.,)];

+.'j7''( -'-i+'--+(-''(j )*

The integrated part tends to zero at each limit, since x+k is negative
and x + k + l is positive : so we have

r, z) = lT, z+i).

The same proof applies when x lies between and -1, and leads to the
result

r z+i)=zr2 z) (0>.r>-i).

The last equation shews that, between the values and -1 of a*,

To z) = r(z).

The preceding equation then shews that To z) is the same as T (2) for

\Subsection{12}{2}{2}{Hankers expression of TODO as a contour integral.}

The integrals obtained for T z) in
\hardsectionref{12}{2}, \hardsubsectionref{12}{2}{1} %TODO:cite multiple
are members of a
large class of definite integrals by which the Gamma-function can be
defined. The most general integral of the class in question is due to
Hankel*; this integral will now be investigated.

Let D be a contour which starts from a point p on the real axis,
encircles the origin once counter-clockwise and returns to p.

Consider 1 (-t)~~ e~hlt, when the real part of z is positive and z is
not an integer.

The many-valued function (- ty~ is to be made definite by the
convention that (- ty~ = e' ~ ' ° '"*' and log (- t) is purely real
when t is on the negative part of the real axis, so that, on D, - ir %
arg (- t) % it.

The integrand is not analytic inside D, but, by \hardsectionref{5}{2} corollary 1, the
path of integration may be deformed (without affecting the value of
the integral) into the path of integration which starts from p,
proceeds along the real axis to h, describes a circle of radius h
counter-clockwise round the origin and returns to p along the real
axis.

On the real axis in the first part of this new path we have arg (- ) =
- tt, so that - ty~' - e~ '' ~ H ~ (where log i is purely real); and
on the last part of the new path (- ty- = e " ' - ' t ' .

On the circle we write - i = 8e*; then we get

Now, since the contour C does not pass through the point t = 0, there
is no need longer to stipulate that the real part of 2 is positive;
and

I (-ty~ e~ dt is a one-valued analytic function of z for all values of
2.

Hence, by \hardsectionref{5}{5}, the equation, just proved when the real part 0/2 is
positive, persists for all values of z with the exception of the
values 0, ±1, +2

Consequently, for all except integer values of,

r(0) = -\ J - I -ty-'e-'dt.

\hardsubsectionref{12}{1}{4}, we get the further result that

We shall write / for \, meaning thereby that the path of inte-

the positive direction and returns to the starting point.

The notation employed is that introduced at the end of \hardsubsectionref{12}{2}{2} and
means that the path of integration starts from P, encircles the point
1 in the positive (counter-clockwise) direction and returns to P, then
encircles the origin in the positive direction and returns to P, and
so on.

At the starting-point the arguments of t and - t are both zero; after
the circuit (1 +) they are and l-ir; after the circuit (0 +) they are
Itt and 27r; after the circuit (1 - ) they are lir and and after the
circuit (0 - ) they are both zero, so that the final vahie of the
integrand is the same as the initial value.

It is easily seen that, since the path of integration may be deformed
in any way so long as it does not pass over the branch points 0, 1 of
the integrand, the path may be taken to be that shewn in the figure,
wherein the four parallel lines are supposed to coincide with the real
axis.

// the real parts of a. and y9 are positive the integrals round the
circles tend to zero as the radii of the circles tend to zero*; the
integrands on the paths marked a, h, c, d are

respectively, the arguments of t and 1 - nuiu being zero in each case.

Hence we may write e (a, ) as the sum of four (possibly improper)
integrals, thus :

e (a, /3) = e- '(''+ )

Now e (a, /S) and this last expression are analytic functions of a and
of /3 for all values of a and /S. So, by the theory of analytic
continuation, this equality, proved when the real parts of a and are
positive, holds for all values of a and l3. Hence for all values of a

We shall now shew how the repeated integral

/ = f f . . . I f t, + t,+ ...+ tn) i"'- o" - . . . tn' n-idt dt, . .

may be reduced to a simple integral, where/is continuous, a > (?* = 1,
2, ... n) and the integration is extended over all positive values of
the variables such that 1 + 4+ ... + tn \$1.

(where we have written t, T, a, j3 for t, t, cui, Og and X for 3 + 4

Changing the order of integration \hardsubsectionref{4}{5}{1}), the integral becomes

Putting T = VTo, the integral becomes
